Instance variables : unique for each Instance
    in __INIT__ method: first, last, pay, email : these are the  instance variables and are set for each instance when it is created 
    (when we initiate a instance, the  __INIT__ medthod is run which sets that instance variables/arguments)

Class variable : is the same for all instances of a class
    
    We know that when defining a method, we access arguments in 1 of 2 ways:
    - using "self" = the instance of the class 
    - using the class itself
     
     When accessing the argumement using 'self'(through the instance) it gives us the option to set the argument for that specific instance
     (at which time the argument is added to the instance namespace if the instance did not have that argument in its namespace)

    


Writing a method, we would never use:

self.num_of_emps += 1 because the number of employees should not be changeable for a specific instance, but be an argmument of the class

so we would use:

employee.num_of_emps += 1 > counter for num_of_emps is augmented and this argument is a class variable that is instance-independant.
