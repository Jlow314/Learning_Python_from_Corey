""""
a) create a class
b) instantiate a class

Why a class: group data and functions to easily reuse them.

Data associated to a class =  attrbute
functions associated to a class =  method

Example:
Each employee has its own attributes like name, age, mail ...
Each employee can perform actions

We create the employee class. Which is a blueprint for creating instances.
Each employee we create using the employee class will be an instance of that class.
